<h2 id="brisbane">Brisbane</h2>
<p>Brisbane is <strong>brilliant</strong>. I really love this place. </p>

<p>There are <strong>fantastic libraries</strong> in beautiful spots (the State Library of Queensland sits on this huge river, with lots of modern architecture and is really quite wonderful), and the Brisbane City library is just across from it. </p>
<p>This trip is rapidly evolving into a <em>tour du biblioth√®que</em>, I regret nothing. </p>

</div>
<p>The public transportation is robust - the Brisbane city council <a href="https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-and-transport/public-transport/citycat-and-ferry-services/inner-city-ferry-services">operates free catamarans</a> that run up and down the river, and there's a developed bus system. There are entire city blocks dedicated to just jungle and art, and long stretches of &quot;nature walks&quot; along the river. </p>
<p>Also, birds - lots of them, everywhere.</p>

<p>The first is named a &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy_miner">noisy miner</a>&quot; (my new favorite name for a bird), the second an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_white_ibis">Australian white ibis</a>. </p>
<p>And, the most important bit. </p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/fkWDULWs6WthbSsj6">The Hideout</a> has unquestionably the best coffee + croissants I've had in Australia so far and is reasonably-priced, too - and, following a week of being here I've achieved first-name status with the baristas. Ode to familiarity. </p>

<p>That said, Brisbane is expensive, as far as cities go. The cheapest hostel price I've found around here is ~30 USD, or 50 AUD - compared to the ~30 or ~25 AUD elsewhere. I've been excusing it by working a ton - the last week has been more or less ritually sacrificed to the gods of productivity. </p>

<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>
<p>While I've been here, some new developments have come up. </p>
<p>First, we're officially (probably!) presenting my solar project at the <a href="https://spd.aas.org/meetings">AAS Solar Physics Division</a> - and, hopefully, publishing a paper later. The conference is August 13-18, and definitely something I ought to attend, though a remote option is available. </p>
<p>It's news that brings both feelings of intense excitement and a quiet anxiousness. It puts a time limit to my story here in Australia - and also means I need to put in a <strong>lot</strong> of work prior to the 13th. We haven't finished the paper yet, nor is the project complete - <a href="https://blog.andromeda.is/work/">most of my time here in Brisbane has been spent on it</a>, and even following 40 hours of work I fear it needs at least twice that to approximate something scientifically acceptable. </p>
<p>I'm <em>anxiousexcitednervousokay</em>. By the time I return to the States, ideal world? I'm stable. Ready to rock. More thoughts on that later. </p>
<p>Anyway. Tomorrow I'm leaving Brisbane. I'm thinking I'll pick up a wetsuit before heading out - open sea scuba cert is too much money - but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freediving">freediving isn't</a> :)</p>
<!-- ---

On a more serious note - an idea I've been considering while here in Brisbane has been the idea of trust in belief. 

I need to trust, not only that this journey is of relevance and significance, but also **that which I believe** is relevant, significant and important to me. It may not be true for everyone, or even most. But, perhaps it is true for me; and maybe that's enough. 

What do I believe?

A lot. I believe that modern society has brought us to a point where it's easy to lose belief; nihilism is common. I believe in the kindness of the individual and that cruelty is pointless. I believe life is incredibly short, and incredibly long; that maturity is not tied to age, nor is it tied to experience, but rather to narrative. I believe in the existence of other life forms; I believe they're probably wildly different from us, and the same in many ways. I believe the world is beautiful and every single moment holds an infinity of possible meaning. I believe it really sucks that globalization is steadily eroding the power of local culture, and I believe that only through globalization can we hope to mature as a species and move forward. I believe that space is the final frontier, and that it is forever going to be a place that humanity can never claim "we have conquered this, and it is ours". I believe there are intangible things in the world that only poetry and narrative can only hope to approximate. I believe that we're meant to have close company, and that loneliness is a byproduct of an inefficient society, and that homelessness is a natural byproduct of the artificial system of capitalism we live in. With success there will come failure. I think that democracy and capitalism are excellent systems to govern our world; and I hate many parts of them still. I'm an anarchist by spirit and a democrat by intellect. I believe that the present day dictates how the future will move; I believe that the past should be remembered but only to be used as a lesson and not a mirror. I believe that the ancient Norse culture was a fascinating subject of study and that the world would be wildly different without the colonial exploitation of so much of the world. I believe that rationalism is only one way we can describe the world, and believe there is more to the world than can be observed by repetition alone. I believe that the study of quantum mechanics is a brilliant next move for physics as a field and will introduce amazing, beautiful and unexpected breakthroughs. I believe humanity as a whole is doomed to die a sad death, and believe that we have the potential within us to evolve and triumph as a race. I believe that optimism is easy with ignorance and pessimism is easy with knowledge; and that it is crucial we remain optimistic in the face of overwhelming knowledge of the world. I believe in believing; I believe the truth is only a belief and that is enough. I believe some questions are unanswerable though most are; and I believe in the idea of better. 

I believe in love, and beauty, and in the power of solitude to clarify the world, and I'm trying to learn to believe that I believe all of these things, but it's hard sometimes.  -->
