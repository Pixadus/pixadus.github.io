<p><strong>Bairnsdale, 3:10 PM</strong></p>
<p>This morning, I woke up to be greeted by a truly <strong>brilliant</strong> sunrise, the <strong>sound of waves</strong> off in the distance, <strong>crisp</strong>, <strong>clean</strong> post-rain air ...</p>
<p>... And a flat tire. </p>
<div class="gallery">
    <a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52926795971_825adb16e7_k_d.jpg" data-ngthumb="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52926795971_39920b9dba_c_d.jpg"></a>

<p>Looks like at some point I picked up a 2 inch galvanized nail through my rear wheel. </p>
<p>Let's ignore that for now, and talk about my new friends <strong>Meita</strong>, <strong>Nick</strong> and <strong>Andrea</strong>. </p>
<div class="gallery">
    <a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52926232452_1ee2281108_k_d.jpg" data-ngthumb="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52926232452_0abc1fb619_c_d.jpg   "></a>

<p>Meita and Nick were both camped out next to me this morning. Meita, a Danish working holidayer, had met Nick at a farm, and they were vansteading it up north to warmer climes, playing it day-by-day. Their setup was <em>so</em> sweet - I ... will not claim to <em>regret</em> the motorcycle life, but oh my a van would be so <strong>nice</strong> sometimes. </p>
<p>Anyways. I set out to New South Wales around 10:30 AM, readying myself for a full day of travelling, and confidently made it all of 20 feet before realizing the bike's rear wheel was flat as day-old soda. </p>
<p>I limped it about 4 kilometers before I was driving more on rim than tire, and I pulled over into a suburb where I assessed my options very calmly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have comprehensive motorcycle insurance, and they won't cover a flat tire? Seriously? The $500 emergency parts supply doesn't actually apply to tires? Why!? That's so dumb! Stupid, greedy - </p>
<p>&quot;No, don't worry,&quot; I replied to the insurance agent. &quot;I understand completely. Thank you for looking into it for me.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I needed to get the bike into town. I was about 3 kilometers away from town. Options. Hmm. </p>
<ol>
<li>I could drive at a flat 20 and maybe damage the rim. </li>
<li>I could walk into town. Might take a bit. </li>
<li>I could ask around, and see if anyone has a bike pump?</li>
</ol>
<p>Option 3 sounded nicest. So I knocked on some nearby doors. And that's how I met <strong>Andrea</strong>. </p>
<div class="gallery">

<p>Andrea was a Lake Tyers local, studying up for a public health certificate. Andrea is great. Andrea was super sweet. Andrea didn't have a bike pump, but she did me one better - turns out, her son-in-law ran the local tire shop in town. </p>
<p>She gave me a ride into town, and chatted with her son-in-law for a bit, who offered to lend us a portable tire pump. We drove back to the bike, I re-inflated the rear tire a bit, waved my thanks, and <strong>floored it</strong> back to the tire repair stop. They weren't confident about repairing a motorcycle tire, so directed me to a place in Bairnsdale - 30 minutes back the way I came.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No. Damnit. Ugh. Ok. Fine. I can do this. I can ... probably do this. Please, motorcycle gods do me a solid. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopped on the bike. Waved bye to the tire station. 100 km/h'd it up to Bairnsdale, stopping at petrol stops to refill air along the way, and made it to the repair shop in Bairnsdale! </p>
<p>So, Yours Truly is back in Bairnsdale. Which, after some thought, isn't a bad thing - I headed over to <strong>BCF</strong> (Boating, Camping and Fishing), and found that they were selling the <a href="https://darche.com.au/ranger-solo">Darche Ranger Solo+</a>, a swag similar in material to my Dusk-to-Dawn 900, but half the weight and so much smaller.</p>
<p>So much yes. I just posted an ad on Gumtree to sell the Dusk to Dawn, hopefully it gets a bite here soon. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Lake Tyers, 7:48 PM</strong></p>
<p>My tent was stolen. </p>
<p>When I was packing up the bike to head to Bairnsdale, I decided to leave the 13.4 kg swag behind. It was pretty heavy, and I wanted to run as light as I could on the wheel. So, I hid the swag in some bushes and left.</p>
<p>I didn't hide it well enough. </p>
<p>Which, like, fuck. That's $425 AUD worth of swag and sleeping bag that is sort of just gone. </p>
<p>But, to be honest, I'm pretty okay right now. </p>
<ul>
<li>I'm in a motel - only $99 AUD/night,</li>
<li>I have access to a shower,</li>
<li>I bought an <em>incredibly</em> tasty pizza, </li>
<li>And I'm watching Lord of the Rings the Fellowship of the Ring. </li>
</ul>
<p>I'm irritated that I'm out so much money - but, to be honest, it's an irritation I became okay with as soon as it became apparent. It cleans up a lot of things - I no longer have to worry about how to swap this swag out for something lighter, and I don't have to drive all the way back to the Lake Tyers Tavern to camp.</p>
<p>My bike is fixed - not only fixed, but the old, grumpy motorcycle mechanic that threw a new inner tube in <em>also</em> tightened the disc brakes and realigned the wheel for only $120 AUD total. </p>
<p>Stylo runs <strong>great</strong>.</p>
<p>I've learned some lessons about my life that I want to share tomorrow, and read some Aristotle that I want to talk about, and have some ideas surrounding anxiety that I'd like to share and get your thoughts on. </p>
<p>But for now, tonight, I'm going to chill, and enjoy material comforts while I have them. </p>
